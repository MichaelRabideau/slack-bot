What's wrong, Alice?
You look kinda down.
Ah!
Are those pictures from England?
After I spoke with Mama on the phone yesterday,
I started to miss it.
Mama?
That sounds tasty!
She's talking about her mother.
It must be homesickness.
Is that true, Alice?
I know!
I can be your mother's replacement from now on!
What?
Come on, Alice.
I wonder how Poppy's doing.
Who?
Her dog... probably.
Bark, bark!
Sorry for making you worry.
I'm fine now.
I'm over it.
Because all of you are here,
I'm having fun every day!
Alice...
You're such a good girl...
Can I see the album?
Go ahead.
Is this your mom?
Yeah.
She's really pretty!
Do you take after your father?
Really? That's the first time someone's said that to me.
Who's this girl?
She's my friend from England.
Friend? You had a friend?
I did.
Friend?
Y-Yes.
I never knew Alice had friends in England...
That makes me kind of sad...
Why?
What's she like?
Her name is Karen.
Her father's Japanese, so I learned how to speak Japanese from her.
I think you two would get along, Shino.
Alice's blonde-haired friend...
If I became friends with her...
I'd have a flower in each hand!
She's back to usual.
Thanks for letting us see it.
It was interesting.
Let me see your photo albums sometime.
Never!
Hey, calm down.
S-Sorry.
But still,
there are pictures of me naked!
That's just from when you were a baby!
The rain stopped.
You're right.
You might've been feeling down because of the rain.
You might be right.
It's a rainbow!
England lies at the other end of that rainbow!
How poetic.
Rain boots.
I feel like I've been seeing a lot of foreigners lately.
Maybe you've just been noticing them more because of Alice.
Oh yeah,
I saw a blonde-haired girl around here the other day.
Please tell me more!
She wasn't particularly tall,
she was wearing a parka with a union jack on it,
and she had silky blonde hair
and grey eyes.
Yeah,
pretty much like this.
Wait, isn't that her?
A beautiful blonde-haired girl!
Huh? Karen?
Alice!
Alice, Alice!
Karen.
Who's this?
Shino, you're not part of this reunion!
My name is Kujou Karen!
Oh!
She's Alice's friend from the pictures.
Oh yeah, she said you were a half.
Karen, how did you come to Japan?
I didn't mean literally!
It's a long story.
Isn't Alice here?
Well, Alice has gone to Japan to study.
Japan?
Papa, what's Japan like?
Japan is great.
It's my home country.
Why don't we move to Japan for a while?
That's how.
Just like that?
Blonde hair...
Shino, we have to go to school.
That's right...
I'm starting my language study today too!
A school uniform?
Wait, isn't that our school uniform?
Correct!
I've transferred in!
Sh-Shino...
Too bad Karen ended up in a different class.
Let's go see her later.
I can't wait for lunch break!
Huh? Alice, you don't look very happy.
That's not true.
Alice, I've come!
Karen, your Japanese got a lot better.
I studied hard every day!
Karen, did you grow up in England?
Even though you're a half, you have an accent.
I usually speak English with Papa.
I want to be as fluent as Alice!
Accents are where it's at!
They're so cute!
I still have long way to go.
Japanese is difficult language.
She's trying too hard.
there are a lot of people with names that make sense both in Japan and abroad.
Like Lisa and Naomi.
Papa gave me my name.
You write it like the "lovely" in "lovely flower".
What a beautiful name.
He definitely gave you that name in the hope that you'd grow up to be a lovely girl.
Shino, what about me?
You were named with the hopes that you'd be as small and cute as a squirrel, right?
A squirrel?
I see!
Ah, squirrel.
No way.
Youko.
Shinobu.
Um...
I'm Aya.
Ayaya?
One syllable too many.
It's Aya.
Ayaya! Ayaya!
Ayaya!
Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya! Ayaya!
Stop it.
Please call me Shino.
It's what the people close to me use.
Are you a ninja, Shino?
Can you walk on walls?
Oh, like shinobi.
Not really...
Aw, you can't?
That's not true! Shino is super amazing! She can do anything!
Now, Shino! Walk the walls!
Impossible!
What's gotten into you, Alice?
You've been acting weird.
How have I been weird?
You're jealous of Karen, aren't you?
Really?
It's true that Karen's height is normal,
and also that her speech is a lot more foreigner-like and appealing,
but there are still lots of things I like about you, Alice!
Be more confident in yourself!
You're only making it worse, Shino.
Alice and Karen...
Karen, sorry I left for Japan without telling you.
I wanted to go to school in Japan no matter what.
And I wanted to see Shino again...
There was something I still had to do.
A promise from when we were kids.
It's the reason I followed you to Japan!
A promise?
Yes!
I wanted to return the pencil you lent me back then.
Thanks.
Seriously, who cares?!
My house is this way!
Oh, okay. See you.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
See you tomorrow!
A foreigner!
It's a foreigner!
Karen!
In Japan, you're supposed to just say "goodbye" and leave!
Oh, I see!
Japan is so cool!
Yeah!
Oh, have you already tried natto?
Sometimes they speak to each other in English!
Wow, that's so cool!
There's something special about the aura they exude!
It's like they're celebrities or something!
Should I get their autographs?
M-Me too!
Hey, Alice! I found something really cool!
Oh my god, did you know that?
Although there is octopus inside takoyaki,
taiyaki has no sea bream in it!
That's common sense.
What? You tried taiyaki already?
Cool! You're already an expert of Japan!
I wonder what they're talking about.
Must be something cool.
That was a good nap!
What, really?
You see, I want to make friends in my own class,
but it's not going very well.
You just transferred in, so that's normal.
And being a foreigner makes you even harder to approach.
You're only a half, but you've got the aura of a full foreigner.
Huh?
To use an animal metaphor,
it's like Karen's a lion trying to mingle with deer!
I have to run!
Shino, I'm not sure about that metaphor.
Come to think of it, Aya-chan has experience transferring schools.
You moved here in the first year of middle school.
Y-Yeah.
Oh, you're my senpai!
Please give me advice on how to make friends with the people in my class!
R-Right.
The most important thing...
...is to read the atmosphere!
Oh, you mean like a weather vane?
The atmosphere, not the wind.
I'm Oomiya Shinobu.
Can I call you Aya-chan?
S-Sure. Do as you wish.
Please let me show you around the school!
Come with me!
Y-You don't have to bother.
I got a map of the school from the teacher.
Ah, but it's not like I don't want you to...
You're opening old wounds...
Aya-chan, what's wrong?
Sorry I couldn't help.
After that,
Youko-chan dragged you around the school anyway.
Aya!
What are you doing all by yourself?
Oh, sorry! I haven't introduced myself yet, have I?
I'm Inokuma Youko.
Just call me Youko.
Okay.
Nice to meet you!
Oh, right!
Looks like you have nothing better to do, so I'll show you around the school!
Let's go!
Do you have time today?
Wait...
Can I go to your house?
Yeah, she stuck to me until she got used to her new school.
I still remember her standing there like an abandoned puppy.
That's not true! Don't talk nonsense!
It's the truth!
You two get along so well.
I understand!
Returning a favor.
Extreme happiness.
What are those?
We have to show them our Japanese power!
Yakiniku combo meal.
Heian era?
Those too!
Such carefree smiles...
We've lost!
Sensei, can you explain this part?
Me too, me too!
I asked first!
I ended up sleeping twelve hours!
That's way too much.
What are you doing, Karen?
Oh, Shino.
I see.
The people in your class haven't warmed up to you yet.
I wonder if it's because of my sharp eyes.
Shino, you have it nice. You're calm and easy to talk to.
It's just a matter of time before they open up to you.
Your smile is brilliant.
You might even be able to make a hundred friends.
I like everyone here since they're all very nice,
but there's something special about you, Shino.
You're embarrassing me.
Hey, Alice!
Alice, you were there?
Karen, I'm sure you'll fit in with everyone in no time.
I hope so.
Fight!
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
Karen, that parka is so cute!
It's my favorite!
Isn't it against school rules though?
Oh yeah, Karen, are you going to join a club?
A club?
Alice, are you in any?
We're all in the Go Home Club.
No, the Shino Club!
Huh? What's that?
It's a club where we talk and have lunch with Shino!
Wow! I want to join!
I'm the president, okay?
Oh, is that how it was?
Um, so it's basically a fan club?
I feel better already!
I'm going to talk to everyone in my class today!
I think I'll definitely be able to make friends!
Good luck.
Roger!
That is all.
Does anyone have any announcements they'd like to share with the class?
Me! I do!
Kujou-san?
What is it?
Don't worry! I'm not going to eat you!
I may have come from England,
but I'm a high schooler, just like you!
I want to be friends with you!
Don't be afraid to talk to me!
I'll try to talk to you too!
Karen-san, let's be friends!
Me too!
Everyone!
Wow, she did it.
Karen's amazing.
Don't worry! Even if we don't speak the same language,
but we can communicate as long as we try to listen to each others' hearts!
Yeah, she really is!
Thank you, thank you!
Let's get along!
Um, Karen-chan...
Bye bye!
They're all talking to me!
Success!
Good for you.
Karen's always been bold and straightfoward.
But that's what I like about her.
Thank you!
I love you too, Alice!
Karen, what about me?
Of course, I love you too!
Karen, you're being too bold!
Oh? Alice is jealous again!
I'm not jealous!
I know, I know.
If I had been bolder in middle school,
maybe I would've made friends with everyone immediately, like Karen.
But how you can remain calm and think carefully is what I like about you.
At least your reactions are honest.
Sh-Shut up!
You sure were sweet back then.
Geez! Stop talking!
Yesterday, I climbed one more step up the ladder to adulthood!
Oh? Congratulations.
At least act like you're interested!
Don't brush it off!
You see, I went to a ramen place yesterday and had ramen all by myself!
You went by yourself?!
How adultlike.
Even I only go to fast food places alone!
Hey, boss! Give me a ramen.
One ramen!
Make it hot!
Amazing in more ways than one!
She knows no fear!
Karen, you smell really nice.
That's the shampoo!
Shino, you smell nice too!
Like incense!
And like a dresser!
I don't! I don't, right?
S-See you next time.

Three, two, one, go!
Nothing stands in our way
Our path is looking bright
Let's meet our failures with smiles
and climb this mountain together
The bright morning sun
signals the start of a brand-new day
With my face half-asleep
I say good morning to all my neighbors
There are still shining treasures
hidden in our daily lives
that we have yet to find
Come look for them with me
Just like the small puddle in front of us
the things that keep us up at night
can be easily hurdled with a running start
Just remember to smile!
Yay, yay, everything will turn out fine
We're already having a blast
Take those eyes you've squeezed closed
and open them up to the world
Nothing we face can scare us
Let's go, let's go, I know we can do it
Wow, she's so cute.
Homestay?
Awesome! You mean you're going to live with a family in another country?
Where are you going?
England!
One of my mom's friends is letting me stay at her place for a week.
But Shino, you don't speak any English!
How rude.
I speak a little.
Like "hello".
What else?
"Cut-pan"!
That's wasei-eigo!
I'll be praying for your safe return every day you're gone.
I heard that a girl around my age will be there.
Wow, maybe you two can be friends!
I hope so!
Maybe she'll be a dame!
Daddy's home!
Thank you very much.
Coming!
Welcome, Shinobu.
Nice to meet you! Thanks for letting me stay.
Hello.
K-Konnichiwa.
What a beautiful golden color!
Let's be friends!
She's a bit shy.
It's fine.
You can keep them on.
I feel so English!
This is the living room.
Here's the bathroom.
Feel free to wash your clothes here.
Sure!
Dinner is at seven.
This is your room.
Make yourself at home.
Okay!
Is there anything else you'd like to know?
What's that?
She looks like this doll.
Um, uh...
Poppy, go back to your house.
Alice, she wants to be your friend.
Oo... mi?
Just call me Shinobu.
My name is Alice Cartlett.
Blonde hair!
A blonde girl!
Come back here!
They're already getting along very well.
Japanese girls are so scary!
I hope you're good with unfamiliar foods.
Thanks for the food.
Shinobu, how is it?
It's great!
Aren't you going to eat your desert?
Nope.
Oh, there's going to be a Japanese girl staying at your house?
Sounds like fun!
But I don't speak much Japanese...
I know! While the Japanese girl's at my house, why don't you live with me and be my little sister?
No, I'd be the big sister.
Besides, I'll be travelling tomorrow.
Karen, your family travels so much...
Ta-da!
Here.
You can use this weird doll as a lucky charm.
You'll be fine!
Even if you don't speak the same language,
you'll be able to understand each other by listening to your hearts!
Easy for you to say...
Hey, Poppy!
Come here!
Come on!
Yay! Good boy, Poppy!
You're so clever, Poppy!
Alice! Good morning!
Poppy!
You're not hurt, are you?
Nope, not at all.
Has Alice apologized yet?
No, it wasn't her fault.
I'll warm some milk up for you.
Thank you.
Um, well...
Hello!
Thanks for giving me this!
It's very warm!
"Arigatou"?
Thank you?
Yeah, arigatou!
You're not mad at me?
Of course not! It was very warm!
As sort-of thanks,
there's something I'd like to give you.
Chocolate?
This way!
Here you go.
I got you a souvenir from Japan.
I meant to give it to you yesterday, actually.
My big sister picked it out.
She said that a foreigner would like it.
Let's try it out.
First you do this, and then...
I see! You put it in your hair!
Thanks, Onee-chan!
Alice, I get it now!
You put it in your hair and twirl it around.
Twirl.
Sorry I couldn't get it to work.
Shinobu?
Arigatou.
Use it as a chopstick or something...
Shinobu, do you like baking?
Mix it well!
Arigatou!
Here, here!
We'll drive you to the airport tomorrow.
Let's play Hanafuda!
Wow, Hanafuda!
I don't know the rules though...
What about Hyakunin Isshu?
Or Fukuwarai?
Cool! I've never seen these before!
She asked if you were actually Japanese.
I'm a hundred percent Japanese!
Alice, what do you think?
I put some cherry blossom scented powder in the tub.
I heard you don't take very many baths here.
Go in all the way up to your shoulders.
This smells like Japan...
Shinobu, I feel dizzy!
Good night.
Konnichiwa.
Can I sleep next to you?
What is Japan like?
"Japan"... oh, Nihon.
It's morning over there right now.
Isn't it strange?
Over here, it's all dark,
but the sun is already up in Japan.
It's like it's just the two of us, tucked in between the corners of the world.
Aya-chan said she liked talking about this kind of stuff.
Right, Aya-chan's my friend from school...
Oh, and there's also Youko-chan...
I hope I can visit Japan someday...
I've been friends with Youko-chan since elementary school...
Thanks for letting me stay!
Come play again sometime.
I'll send you the picture.
Konnichiwa!
Japan...
Shinobu, wake up!
You're going to be late!
Okay...
Shinobu!
Shinobu, school!
I'm leaving!
Morning, Shinobu-chan.
Good morning!
G-Good morning...
And then, like...
Finally.
Shino, you're late!
Sorry, I was reading this letter I got...
A letter?
Wow, airmail!
Is it from the girl you stayed with in England a few years ago?
Yeah, it's from Alice!
That's so cool!
Like the one from Wonderland?
She's from England...
It's all written in English,
so I couldn't read it...
I thought you said you were reading it!
Here, let me see.
Whoa, it's real English!
"Dear Shinobu"...
My name is Oomiya Shinobu, after all...
You're in high school now, you know.
Save this for later!
This is the first letter you've gotten from her, isn't it?
Yeah, I wonder what it says.
I guess I'll read it for you.
Let me see.
I think it says she's coming to Japan.
Probably.
Wow, Aya-chan! You can read English?
Does it say when she's coming?
Don't let her down.
Sh-Shut up, Youko!
"Your school"...
"Happy"...
"Uniform"...
Happy uniform?
Shino, your shoes!
Sorry, I'll be right back!
Excuse me, you two.
Wow, a blonde girl!
Do you know a girl named Shinobu?
Huh? Shino?
I don't have a recent picture of her, but...
She looks just like this doll!
That's rude!
There's where you were.
Cartlett-san, this way!
See you later.
Castanet?
Her name sounds fun to play!
Sorry I took so long.
Something's up.
That girl was wearing our uniform.
More importantly, she seemed to think Shino was a wooden doll.
That?
Good morning, Sensei!
Oomiya-san, you're cheerful as usual.
Yep!
Come on in.
That's her!
Alice?
It's been so long!
You really came!
Yeah, I came to see you.
Alice, your Japanese...
I studied!
That's amazing!
But why did you come here?
Cartlett-san, please introduce yourself to the class.
Ah, sorry.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Alice Cartlett.
I transferred from a school in England.
She just realized?
I wrote you a letter.
It was in English...
I thought you might not be able to read it, so I wrote romaji on the second page.
Aya...
Everyone,
let's get along!
Right after we start high school,
a foreign girl transfers in.
Her hair and her eyes are just like a doll's!
I know, right?
I want to put a dress on her and stick her in a showcase
and then just stare at her all day!
Kidding.
That was a joke! Please laugh!
We all thought you were serious.
Here, we wrote our names.
Th-Thank you.
Ko-mi-chi A-ya.
I-no-ku-ma Yo-u-ko.
"Ino" as in boar, and "kuma" as in bear!
Doesn't it sound strong and powerful?
I-I don't think... I would... be very... tasty...
Why are you talking like that!?
That hairpin is really cute.
Shinobu gave it to me when she did her homestay at my house.
And you kept it all this time?
Oh, but she thought that you were supposed to stab things with it...
...like people.
Scary.
Seriously?
Where are you going to stay while you're in Japan?
You came by yourself, right?
Oh, I'm staying at Shinobu's...
Poor you, all alone with no place to live!
You can stay at my house!
It's nothing special, but it'll do!
Um, I was already going to...
You two make a good match!
My name is Alice.
Thank you for letting me stay.
Mom, why didn't you tell me Alice was coming?
I had no idea!
I wanted to make it a surprise.
Sorry.
By the way, your Japanese is excellent.
You even sit like a Japanese.
I studied all sorts of stuff about Japan.
I've even worn a kimono.
Sitting like this is painful, and the kimono was really heavy and stifling...
A twelve-layered kimono usually weighs about ten kilograms.
I believed that if I persevered, I could become a yamato nadeshiko.
You don't have to push yourself that hard!
Treat this as your own home.
Just be yourself.
Oh, I got you a souvenir.
How thoughtful.
It's dorayaki that I bought at the airport.
It's from Japan?
During the season of cherry blossoms,
an English girl came to my house.
Alice, welcome to Japan!
My room is foreign-style.
Is your bath a Goemon bath?
Nope!
It was all western-style.
